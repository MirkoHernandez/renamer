# create basic tissue workflow

* tags: documentation

tissue is a very cool and simple issue tracker. Issues can be kept in
version control and be available from the command line, this way
decisions, context and non-code related information can be documented
alongside the project. Additionally issues can be rewritten to better
reflect the state of the project.

## Possible workflow using tissue.

- create issues about main tasks.
- ideally create a commit only including the issue.
